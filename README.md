# Money Transaction App

This project built with a Node.js/Express backend and a minimal custom UI. The core focus is on implementing:

- A secure money transfer system using Mongoose sessions to ensure reliability and atomicity.
- a smart user search feature using MongoDB's regex for easy name discovery. On the client side, debouncing is used to optimize performance by delaying API requests, reducing unnecessary calls while the user types, and ensuring efficient data fetching.
